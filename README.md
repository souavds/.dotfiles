souavds dotfiles

machine: thinkpad t14 gen 5 - intel ultra 5 135u - 64gb ddr5

this dotfiles are to setup my personal and work machine (macos).
if you try to run in your own machine you are responsible for any errors that come up.

it should run flawlessly in machines similar to mine.

the script asks if wants to setup laptop related tools, the only ones i use for my thinkpad are:
- auto-cpufreq
- thermald
- acpi
- fprintd (fingerprint reader)

wanna see the packages that will be installed? check them under ./.scripts/packages/

that's it!
